## 1.History 

> The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and has a long and
> successful history.

* Tycho Brahe in the 16th century allowed ohannes Kepler to discover the empirical laws of planetary motion.
* The discovery of regularities in atomic spectra played a key role in the development and verification of quantum physics in the early twentieth century.

==The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.==

## 2.Recognize handwritten digits
